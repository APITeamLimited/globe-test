Sampler
=======

A sample collection library, heavily inspired by both [go-metrics](https://gitbub.com/rcrowley/go-metrics) and [logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus)' excellent API.

The idea is to create a library to easily emit metrics of any kind, complete with arbitrary metadata. Metrics can then be presented to users, or emitted to a time series database.

(Will be moved out of this repo and made presentable once it's done!)
