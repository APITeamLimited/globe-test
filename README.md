Actively developed by <a href="https://apiteam.cloud">APITeam</a>. APITeam is an all in one platform for designing, testing and scaling your APIs collaboratively.

Note: GlobeTest is not affiliated with the K6 project. This is a fork of the K6 project with modifications to support distributed load testing and other features.

The aim of this project is to provide a simple way to run distributed load tests using the K6 runtime engine that avoids the need for Kubernetes while. A further aim is to provide simultanous concurrent execution of multiple load tests.
More documentation on how to use this shall be added soon.
