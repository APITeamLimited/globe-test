<h3>
K6 Worker Node
</h3>

K6 Worker Node (not Node.js) exposes a redis clien that can accept and run multiple test jobs concurrently and supports streaming and reporting of results back to redis. The setup is aimed to make it easy to run tests in a distributed and headless environment.

The underlying K6 execution engine has been changed as little as possible to support the K6 API
For more information on K6, please see the upstream repo <a>https://github.com/grafana/k6</a>

Actively being developed, documentation is not yet available.
